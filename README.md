# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor



**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular homework assignment, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

    This project consisted of Adding Meta Tags to the code in order to increase the optimization for the web page through search Engines. In other words, the newly added code should maek it easier for the browser and web engine to find the page while searching similar criteria. Through use of keywords, description, and titles the code was enhanced slightly in order to improve SEO and make for a more accessible page. 

    Lastly, there were a few additions made in regards to adding alt tags to the icons and images to provide a back up in case the images fail to laod properly. Additionally, some of the code was altered so that all the links work similarly to each other.

    ##Acceptance Criteria
